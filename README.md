# -Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets-on-Twitter

Data Preprocessing:

Load the provided dataset of tweets and sentiment labels.
Clean the text data by removing special characters, links, hashtags, mentions, and any irrelevant information.
Tokenize the text into words or subwords, considering emoticons and common Twitter abbreviations.
Convert text to lowercase.
Text Vectorization:

Build a vocabulary of words, subwords, hashtags, and mentions from the cleaned and tokenized text.
Utilize techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or subword embeddings (FastText) that capture Twitter-specific language.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable algorithm or architecture. Given the data's sequential nature, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTM, or even Transformer-based models can be effective.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train the chosen model on the training data.
Fine-tune using techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and early stopping.
Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Pay attention to handling class imbalance that's common in sentiment analysis tasks.
Prediction and Inference:

Apply the trained model to classify sentiments in new tweets.
Convert model output probabilities into sentiment labels (e.g., -1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive).
Post-processing and Output:

Convert sentiment labels back to human-readable form for output.
Display or store predicted sentiment labels.
Fine-tuning and Iteration:

Continuously improve the model by iterating over preprocessing steps, architecture, and hyperparameters.
Incorporate domain-specific information about Twitter conventions and trends.
